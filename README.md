Shoe stock management app


Inventory management app, to help manage your shoes stock.
This app helps you to identify how much stock you have now - how many shoes you have in your warehouse.

The app has three functions:

Adding shoes-

In order to add a new shoe to the table you need to have it's serial-number/id, 
brand name, shoe model, the year it came out, size and amount (pieces you have from each shoe).

Edit-

The edit function lets you edit the amount of shoes you have from every piece in your stock.

Delete-

If your bussiness if booming and you got to the point where you sold every piece from a cerain shoe model,
by one click you can just delete it from your inventory table.




To add a calming design to the app, I used your drawing as a background for obvious reasons.... (:
